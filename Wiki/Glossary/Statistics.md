#mutually-exclusive - normally talking of events in probability, two that **cannot** happen at the same time

#probability-measure - a function within probability that maps sets to real numbers

#discrete - a discrete space in probability is an example of a topological space, where points are isolated from each other

#continuous - a continuous space in probability is one where points have no abrupt change in value

#false-positive - incorrectly identifying something that isn't there, e.g. assuming your model works when it doesn't or classifying that someone has cancer when they do not
