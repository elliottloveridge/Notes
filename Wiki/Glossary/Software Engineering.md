#linear-data-structure - data elements arranged in a sequential manner where each element is connected to its previous and next element. Such data structures are easy to implement as computer memory is also sequential. Examples are list, queue, stack, array, etc.

#permutation - An ordering of a list of objects

#lower-bound-complexity - This is the worst case computational complexity for the best possible algorithm for a given problem

#divide-and-conquer - A powerful algorithm design technique to break complex problems into smaller problems that are easier to solve, then combining the answers to solve the original problem. This technique is seen in mergesort, quicksort, performing matrix multiplication, etc.

#hash-map - A fast access data structure
