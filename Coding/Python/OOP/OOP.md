# OOP

## What is OOP?
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) aims to combine the data and the processes that act on it into objects
	- This is known as *encapsulation*
- OOP uses [[Coding/Python/Classes/Classes|classes]] and [[Coding/Python/Methods/Methods|methods]] to combine data and functions that act on that data

### Definitions
- [[Coding/Python/Classes/Classes|Class]]: Template for creating objects
- [[Coding/Python/OOP/Objects|Objects]]: An instance of a class
- [[Coding/Python/Methods/Methods|Methods]]: A function defined within a class
- [[Coding/Python/Classes/Classes#Data Attributes|Data Attribute]]: A variable bound to an instance of a class
