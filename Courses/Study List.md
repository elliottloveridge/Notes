# Study List
## Plan
> Go over some short videos on each of these and only spend extra time on one if you don't understand it. There isn't much point looking into tree variations unless you're implementing them or practicing for a job interview.
> Hash tables are most relevant for Python dictionaries
- **Data Structures**
	- Arrays
	- Linked Lists
	- Stacks
	- Queues
	- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
	- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
	- Hash Tables
> Binary search is important here and could be something you implement yourself outside of a computer program; same for recursion. The rest is worth some high level videos so you don’t feel out of place when reading something and one of the terms is mentioned.
- **Algorithms**
	- Graphs (Graph Traversal, Shortest Path Algorithms)
	- Sorting Algorithms
	- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
	- Dynamic Programming
	- Greedy Algorithms
	- Recursion
	- Divide and Conquer
> Worth understanding well
- **Analysis**
	- Big O Notation and Time Complexity
	- Space Complexity
> I couldn’t explain any of these with confidence and could only guess at a few - would just look them up as and when you encounter them.
- **Design Patterns**
	- Singleton Pattern
	- Factory Method Pattern
	- ==[[Observer Pattern]]==
	- ==[Strategy Pattern](Strategy%20Pattern.md)==
	- Decorator Pattern
	- Command Pattern
	- MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern
	- MVP (Model-View-Presenter) Pattern
> No opinion on the course but definitely get stuck into one on DBs if you have the appetite. It would be good to look at cloud service DB offerings and understanding the difference between their many services and when someone might use one over the other.
- **Databases**

	- Composition Over Inheritance
		- Favour object composition over class inheritance to promote flexibility
	- Separation of Concerns
		- Divide software into distinct modules, each addressing a specific concern
	- Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge)
		- Encourage objects to interact with only their immediate neighbours
	- Dependency Injection
		- Inject dependencies into a component rather than hardcoding them
	- Inversion of Control (IoC)
		- Control flow and decision-making are inverted, often achieved through frameworks or containers
> Very important to understand and be able to implement all of this.
- **Testing**
	- Unit Testing
	- Integration Testing
	- Functional Testing
	- Regression Testing
	- Automated Testing

	- API Endpoints
	- Request and Response Format
	- Authentication and Authorization
	- Error Handling
	- API Security
	- API Testing
	- Webhooks
> Understand microservices and serverless. Below is a link to the amazon prime video team talking about moving back to a monolithic arch, which is interesting in the context of AWS providing a cloud service that really promotes the microservice paradigm.

> I would go as deep into this as possible because I think Python will be a valuable tool for a while and its worth investing in knowledge for it.
> I think talks like this are a good way to get exposure without being completely draining: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPiWg5jSoZI
